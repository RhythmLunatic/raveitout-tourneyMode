# Rave It Out: Tournament Mode
This is a separate mode in Rave It Out. You need the original theme to use it!

Grab the regular theme from here: https://github.com/RhythmLunatic/raveitout

Name the cloned folder "raveitout4w". This is important!

Then clone this repo and name this one "Rave It Out Tourney".

Then go to the operator menu of Rave It Out 4 Weebs and press "tournament mode" instead of "game mode"

## Features
It's just the event mode from IIDX.
