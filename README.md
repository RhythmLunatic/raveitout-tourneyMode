# Rave It Out: Tournament Mode
This is a separate mode in Rave It Out. You need the original theme to use it!

Grab the regular theme from here: https://github.com/RhythmLunatic/raveitout

Name the cloned folder "raveitout4w". This is important!

Then clone this repo and name this one "raveitout-tourneyMode", it should already have this name by default when cloned.

Then go to the operator menu of Rave It Out 4 Weebs and press "tournament mode" instead of "game mode"

## Features
It's just the event mode from IIDX.
